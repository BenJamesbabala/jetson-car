http://askubuntu.com/questions/318973/how-do-i-create-a-wifi-hotspot-sharing-wireless-internet-connection-single-adap

After I saw this link offered by vasishath, I managed to setup a wireless hotspot to share the internet connection from the same single wireless interface device. This wireless device must to use an Atheros driver that is already build with nl80211 support. Next I will show you how.
Detect if your wireless device will work with this method

Run the following command in terminal:

lsmod | grep ath

If the output is null or if the string cfg80211 is not in the output, it makes no sense to continue and you should pay attention at second and third point from this answer.
Tools needed

Check whether all the below mentioned packages are installed: iw, hostapd, iptables, udhcpd, udhcpc, macchanger.

You can install these with

sudo apt-get install iw hostapd iptables udhcpd udhcpc macchanger

Edit some files

Run the following command in terminal to edit corresponding files:

sudo -H gedit /etc/hostapd.conf /etc/udhcpd.conf /etc/default/udhcpd /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

    In hostapd.conf file add the following code:

    interface=new1
    driver=nl80211
    ssid=my_wifi_hotspot      #Change the ssid name as you wish
    channel=11                #I sugest you to use the same channel as your wireless network
    hw_mode=g
    wme_enabled=1
    macaddr_acl=0
    auth_algs=1
    ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
    wpa=3
    wpa_passphrase=1234567890 #Change the passphrase as you wish
    wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    wpa_pairwise=TKIP
    rsn_pairwise=CCMP

    In udhcpd.conf file comment all the current lines (by adding a # character in front of the line) and add the following new lines:

    start 192.168.0.102         #These IPs must to be in the same subset as your current default route
    end 192.168.0.117 
    interface new1 

    opt dns 192.168.0.1         #Your current default route (Gateway)
    option subnet 255.255.255.0
    opt router 192.168.0.101    #This IP must to be in the same subset as your current default route
    option  domain  localhost

    In /etc/default/udhcp, comment the line that says DHCPD_ENABLED="no".

    In wpa_supplicant.conf you must provide the settings of your current wireless network. See man wpa_supplicant for some quick examples. And you probably have more examples in /usr/share/doc/wpa_supplicant/ directory. I used something like:

    ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
    network={
      ssid="my_wifi_network"
      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
      proto=WPA
      pairwise=CCMP
      group=CCMP
      psk="mypassphrase"
    }

    Save all the files and close them.

    Note: All of these edits doesn't affect with nothing your current network configuration.

Make a shell script

    In a terminal run mkdir -p bin - this command will make a bin directory in your home folder if you don't already have it.
    After run gedit ~/bin/hotspotsetup.sh - this will create the new file change_sources.sh in gedit.
    Copy and paste the following script in the new created file:

#!/bin/bash

service network-manager stop
sleep 1

pkill -15 nm-applet
sleep 1

ifconfig wlan0 down             #wlan0 - the name of your wireless adapter
sleep 1

iw phy phy0 interface add new0 type station
iw phy phy0 interface add new1 type __ap
sleep 2

ifconfig new0 down
macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 new0
ifconfig new1 down
macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:66 new1
ifconfig new0 up
ifconfig new1 up

ifconfig new1 192.168.0.101 up  #192.168.0.101 - the same IP defined for router in 'udhcpd.conf' file 
hostapd /etc/hostapd.conf &
sleep 2

service udhcpd start

wpa_supplicant -inew0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf &
sleep 10

udhcpc -i new0

echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface new0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface new1 -j ACCEPT

    Save the file and close it.
    Go back into terminal and run: chmod +x ~/bin/hotspotsetup.sh - to grant execute access for the script.

Start the wireless hotspot being connected to a wireless network from the same wireless adapter

Run the above script in terminal with root privileges:

sudo ~/bin/hotspotsetup.sh
