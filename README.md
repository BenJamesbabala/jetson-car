# Jetson Autonomous RC Car

Autonomous RC Car using Deep Learning.

![alt tag](https://github.com/dat-ai/jetson-car/raw/master/img/jetson-car.jpg)

### Goals:
* Get hands-on experience on autonomous vehicle development.
* Understand Deep Learning concepts.
* For Fun ( I probably end up taking the car to some autonomous racing competition. We'll see).

### Hardwares:

* RC Car - RedCat Volcano EPX (stock - no mod)
* NVIDIA Jetson TK1
* Arduino UNO  (probably upgrade to Teensy 3.2 later)
* Intel RealSense R200
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Real-Time-Clock (RTC) DS3231

### Softwares:

* Stock OS for Jetson TK1 (JetPack 21.5)
* Grinch Kernel 21.4
* ROS Indingo for ARM
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow

### Installation Guide:
Will be updated while working on the project

 * Hardware Setup
 
 * Software Setup

* I am very happy if anyone would like to work with me on this project. please shoot me an email at tdat.nguyen93@gmail.com

### Acknowledgements:
* [JetsonHacks](http://www.jetsonhacks.com/) website provides helpful tips and tricks to work with Jetson TK1. JetsonHacks nicely simplifies the installation process with many ready-to-use scripts
* [DuckieTown](http://duckietown.mit.edu), an MIT Course,  is a great place to learn about developing autonomous vehicles.
* UPenn F1/10 Tutorials give a nice introduction to ROS, Hardware installation, and System Architecture for RC Car.

### TODO:
* Program ROS to take control over ESC and Steering motors.
* Create an interface to switch between autonomous/maunual mode. (could it be semi-autonomous? like level 2/3)
* Apply the advantage of Intel Realsense (IR camera) to better reconigze objects.
