Jetson Autonomous RC Car
========================
Autonomous RC Car using ROS and Keras/TensorFlow. Inspired by JetsonHacks

### Goals:
----------
* Get hands-on experience on autonomous vehicle development.
* Understand Deep Learning concepts.
* For Fun ( I probably end up taking the car to some autonomous racing competition. We'll see).

### Dependencies:
-----------------
#### Hardwares:
1. RC Car - RedCat Volcano EPX (stock - no mod) + Extra battery
2. NVIDIA Jetson TK1
3. Teensy 3.2
3. Intel RealSense R200
4. Intel Network 7260
5. Ultrasonic Sensor

#### Softwares:

1. Stock OS for Jetson TK1 (JetPack 21.5)
2. Grinch Kernel 21.4
3. ROS Indingo for ARM
4. Keras using TensorFlow as backend


### Installation Guide:
----------------------
Will be updated

 * Hardware Setup
 
 * Software Setup

### Acknowledgements:
---------------------
* [JetsonHacks](http://www.jetsonhacks.com/) website provides helpful tips and tricks to work with Jetson TK1. JetsonHacks nicely simplifies the installation process with many ready-to-use scripts
* [DuckieTown](http://duckietown.mit.edu), an MIT Course,  is a great place to learn about developing autonomous vehicles.
* UPenn F1/10 Tutorials give a nice introduction to ROS, Hardware installation, and System Architecture for RC Car.

### TODO:
* Create an interface to switch between autonomous/maunual mode. (could it be semi-autonomous? like level 2/3)
* Apply the advantage of Intel Realsense (IR camera) to better reconigze objects.
