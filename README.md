### Resources:
* [JetsonHacks](http://www.jetsonhacks.com/) website provides helpful tips and tricks to work with Jetson TK1. JetsonHacks nicely simplifies the installation process with many ready-to-use scripts
* [DuckieTown](http://duckietown.mit.edu), an MIT Course,  is a great place to learn about developing autonomous vehicles.
* UPenn F1/10 Tutorials give a nice introduction to ROS and Hardware installation for RC Car.
