If the necessary drivers can be built as kernel modules, that's a lot easier than reflashing the kernel. Here's approximately how I got my usb wifi dongle going. (Take this with a grain of salt as it's my first time fooling around with kernel sources in about 10 years!)

On the TK1, download and unpack the L4T kernel sources to ~/kernel (or whatever) https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/mobile/files/L4T/kernel_src.tbz2
zcat /proc/config.gz > ~/kernel/.config
make menuconfig
find the goodies you need and set them to compile as modules...for wifi I think you need cfg80211, mac80211, and the driver for your particular device
make prepare; make modules_prepare
make modules SUBDIRS=net/wireless, make modules SUBDIRS=net/mac80211, make modules SUBDIRS=drivers/net/wireless, and so on for any other relevant subdirectories of the kernel source tree containing modules you need
copy the built .ko files to /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel
depmod -a
apt-get install linux-firmware
add entries for the necessary modules to /etc/modules and reboot

I got bluetooth working this way too (bluetooth, hidp, btusb, and dongle-specific driver). I've hit a wall with my TV tuner stick though, which seems to need some stuff in the kernel that can't be built as modules. So I'd also like to see NVIDIA provide a step-by-step for compiling and installing a kernel (ideally without resetting the whole root FS).
